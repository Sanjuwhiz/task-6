# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
Understand how to create strong passwords and evaluate their strength using online password strength tools.

## Steps

### 1. Create Sample Passwords
Use multiple passwords with different complexity levels:

- Very Weak: `password`
- Weak: `Sanjai`
- Medium: `Sanjai123`
- Medium: `sanjai123`
- Strong: `Sanjai@123`
- Strong: `Sanju_Whiz@123`

### 2. Use Online Password Strength Checkers
Recommended free tools:
- passwordmeter.com
- Kaspersky Password Checker
- LastPass Strength Tester

### 3. Test Each Password
For every password, collect:
- Score / rating  
- Strength label (Weak / Medium / Strong)  
- Estimated time to crack  
- Feedback from the tool  

### 4. Example Evaluation Table

| Password           | Score | Strength   | Time to Crack | Feedback                                |
|-------------------|-------|------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| password          | 5%    | Very Weak  | <1 sec         | Common word, extremely unsafe            |
| Sanjai            | 10%   | Weak       | <1 sec         | Too short, predictable                   |
| Sanjai123         | 40%   | Medium     | Minutes        | Add symbols & increase length            |
| sanjai123         | 35%   | Medium     | Minutes        | No uppercase, predictable pattern        |
| Sanjai@123        | 75%   | Strong     | Hours–Days     | Good mix, but can be longer              |
| Sanju_Whiz@123    | 95%   | Very Strong| Years–Centuries| Excellent complexity and randomness      |

*(Scores and cracking times will vary depending on the tool used.)*

### 5. Best Practices Learned
- Use **12–16+ characters**  
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
- Avoid names, dictionary words, or predictable patterns  
- Use unique passwords for each account  
- Prefer a password manager for secure storage  

### 6. Research Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all combinations  
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common words or leaked passwords  

### 7. Summary: How Complexity Affects Security
- Longer passwords drastically increase cracking time  
- Mixed characters add randomness  
- Symbols + length make passwords harder to guess  
- Complex passwords resist brute-force and dictionary attacks  

## Deliverables
- Password strength evaluation table  
- Security summary report  
- Best practices for strong passwords
